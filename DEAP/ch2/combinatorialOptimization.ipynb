    "\n",
    "This is quite a simple problem to represent as it we can use a list of binary values, with each item corrosponding to an item on the list. So for this problem that will be a list of 22 integers of the value 0 or 1. With 1 meaning that the item is picked from the list and visversa for 0. This list of binary values will be used as a chromosome. Since we have to also stay within the limits of the knapsack we need to included this restriction within the soultion, a way to do this is wait till the soultion gets evaulated. We then evaluate by adding the weights of the chosen item one by one whilst ignoring any chosen items that cause the weight to exceed the knapsacks maximum value. From a genentic algorthimic point of view this will mean that the chromosome of the indvidiual (genotype) may not fully express itself when it is used as an actual solution (phenotype). This is often referred to as genotype to phenotype mapping."
